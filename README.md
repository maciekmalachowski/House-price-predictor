#### Predictor is a web application built on `django`. It uses models written in `jupyter-notebook`, which are responsible for all predictions. 

#### To select the parameters of the house, the application uses `django-forms`, which automatically enters the data into the database and returns the result of the prediction in the form of price and details that we selected for our dream house in **Ames city**.
