#### Predictor is a web application built on `django` along with machine learning features. The application models are written in `jupyter-notebook`, which uses `RandomForestRegressor` to properly create all predictions. 

#### To select the parameters of the house, the application uses `django-forms`, which automatically enters the data into the database and returns the result of the prediction in the form of price and details that we selected for our dream house in **Ames City**. 

#### It also has `user authentication` and all to improve your predictions.
