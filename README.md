# First look
Predictor is a web application built on `django`. It uses models written in `jupyter-notebook`, which are responsible for all predictions. To select the parameters of the house, the application uses `django-forms`, which automatically enters the data into the database and returns the result of the prediction in the form of price and details that we selected for our dream house in **Ames city**. 

# Installation
First, we need to install the requirements contained in the ``requirements.txt``. Open your shell and paste the following comands.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then we have to go to ``server`` folder 
```
cd House-price-predictor/server
```
and run server with this command
```
manage.py runserver
```
After that we will see a link leading to our application and it looks like this:
